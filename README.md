# CoreRPG Coins Weight
This extension calculates coin weight and total monetary wealth.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).

It has been tested with the CoreRPG, Pathfinder 1e, D&D 3.5E, and 5E rulesets. I likely works with many/most other rulesets as well.

Currencies must have weight and value defined in the options menu for these calculations to work and the currency weight option needs to be enabled.

# Features
Coin weight is tracked via a new "Coins" inventory item of the appropriate weight and value for the total of all coins.  If desired, the name of the inventory item can be extended for clarity using "Coins Weight Extension" and it will still be utilzed. For example: Coins (Coins Weight Extension).
This "Coins" inventory entry can be marked uncarried or put into a bag of holding (if using my [extraplanar containers](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/showthread.php?67126-PFRPG-Extraplanar-Containers) extension) to negate the weight.
